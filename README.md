# cs1410_team_project
Team project for app that acts as a registry


### How the folders work:

```
src/
├─ phone_registry/     <---- Our code goes here in the phone_registry folder in src/, because it is tht same thing as the package in eclipse where we store the classes
│  ├─ Phone.java
│  ├─ Phone_App.java
├─ module_info.java

bin/                   <---- We do not touch this folder or its contents, because this is runnable code as it is already binary/compiled
├─ Phone.class
├─ Phone_App.class
```
